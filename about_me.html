  <h1>Introduction</h2>
  <p>A naturalized Canadian who's <strong>small</strong> in stature, but <strong>big</strong> in heart (somewhat like a Tardis - bigger on the inside). I'm a middle-child and I love it.  My default facial expression looks sad/angry, but I'm really not, I promise.  Even if I am, it can always be fixed with a proper serving of <strong>rotisserie chicken</strong>.</p>
  <p>I'm a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/coyg/" target="_blank">Gooner</a>, and one day I'll be at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENwDi9Tu3rQ" target="_blank">Emirates</a> in person to cheer on the squad.</p>

  <h1>Where I'm From</h2>
  <p>I'm from a town just north of <strong>Toronto, Ontario</strong>.  It's been home for about 20 years since my family first made the move from <strong>Hong Kong</strong> in 1995.  Family's important and it's what sustains me. <strong>Love makes me strong <img src="http://appbalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Heart-Container-Battery-Meter.png" alt="8bit heart" height="15" width="15">.</strong></p>
